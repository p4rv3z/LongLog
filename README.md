# LongLog
LongLog is a very simple library that can print large data on Logcat for debugging purpose.

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file
Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
  
  
Step 2. Add the dependency
dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.p4rv3z:LongLog:v-1.0.0'
	}
